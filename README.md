## Features

- Progressive application (PWA)

  Upgrade to Progressive Web App for offline use, closer to the native app experience.

- Code-based Pages + Open API services

  This is a pure front-end application deployed in the Code Cloud Pages service.

  All documents are also hosted in the code cloud to get content through their Open API. In theory, it comes with version management.

- Support markdown

  Native support for markdown format, online parsing.

- Rapid deployment, easy to use

  Quickly deploy through the "initializer" and use it instantly.

  The entire deployment and use process is done online, without the need for Git tools.

- Material Desion

  The component is from Angular Material.

  The official Material Desion has excellent visual effects on the mobile side of the desktop, and comes with two sets of skins, light and dark.

- For modern browsers

  Based on the latest Angular (5.0.0) development, and plans to follow up on the Angular version.

- Recording notes

  Using Git-based YK-DOC as an online notebook with version management, records are not lost, and the phone can be easily read and used.




## Other

This is a project I wrote while learning Angular, using features such as services, pipes, routing, routing guards, event handling, and form validation. If you are also learning Angular, I hope this project can give you some reference.

If you find any deficiencies in the project, thank you!
